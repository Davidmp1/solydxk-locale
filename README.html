First, a short howto on how to start translating.
<ul><li>Download the POT file<br><br></li>
<li>Install Poedit: <strong>sudo apt-get install poedit</strong><br><br></li>
<li>Configure Poedit
<ul><li>Create a directory where you want to safe your translation files.</li>
    <li>Start Poedit: Development > Translation > Poedit</li>
    <li>In Poedit: Edit > Preferences > Translation memory</li>
    <li>Click "Add" to add the language you're translating to.</li>
    <li>Click "Generate database", and add the directory you just created.</li>
    <li>Click "Next" and "Finish", and wait for a long time to finish creating the database.<br><br></li></ul>

<li>Open the POT file<br>
File > New catalog from POT file...<br>
Note: If you already made a translation previously, please open the .po file in Poedit, and update with the accompanied .pot file to add any new translations (Catalog > Update from POT File... ).<br><br>

<strong>Project name and version</strong>: e.g.: softwaremanager 7.5.0 (see naming above)<br>
<strong>Team</strong>: SolydXK<br>
<strong>Team's email address</strong>: admin@solydxk.com<br>
<strong>Language</strong>: your language<br>
<strong>Country</strong>: your country<br>
<strong>Charset</strong>: UTF-8<br>
<strong>Source code charset</strong>: utf-8<br><br>

Catalog > Automatically translate using TM<br>
The more you have translated, the more it will make the translations for you!<br>
These translations are "fuzzy", by default, but If the translation is correct, you can click the cloud-button.<br><br></li>


<li>Start translating :)<br>
Note:</li>
<ul><li>If you need to break a long word, you can do so with a hypen.<br>
E.g.: thisisavery-longword, would end up like:
<ul>thisisavery-<br>
longword</ul></li>
<li>Keep special strings as-is (do not remove, or change in any way): %s, %(tagstring)s, %d, %(tagdigit)d, etc.</li>
<li>Some texts are obviously of a debug nature. You can simply copy them (no need to translate)</li>
</li><br><br></ul>

<li>Save the file<br>
When you save the file, a .mo file is created. This is the file we need.<br>
Note: the .po and the .mo file both have the same name as the package name.<br><br></li>


<li>Test your translation<br>
If you want to test your translation your system needs to be localized in the language you're translating.<br>
You can then copy the .mo file to the corresponding locale directory.<br>
E.g.: I copied my Dutch translation of softwaremanager to:<br>
<strong>/usr/share/locale</strong>/nl/LC_MESSAGES/softwaremanager.mo</li></ul>
